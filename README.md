## Input Data & Variables
`activity_labels.txt`:  Links the class labels with their activity name.

`features.txt</pre`: List of all features.

`features_info.txt`: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

`test/X_test.txt</pre`: Test set.

`test/Y_test.txt`: Test labels.

`train/X_train.txt`: Train set.

`train/Y_train.txt`: Train labels.

## Datasets available for training & testing:
` train/subject_train.txt`: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

` train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt`: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Each row has 128 elements. The same description applies to 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for both the Y and Z axes i.e.

` train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt`: The body acceleration signal obtained = total acceleration - gravity.

` train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt`: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
